/**
 * React-compatible `useActionState` — `[CLIENT]`.
 *
 * Returns a tuple `[state, dispatchAction, isPending]`, where:
 *   - `state` is the current action state.
 *   - `dispatchAction` is an async function that queues an action and resolves to the new state.
 *   - `isPending` is a boolean indicating if any actions are pending.
 *
 * Actions are queued and executed sequentially; each `reducerAction` receives the result of the previous call.
 * The `isPending` flag reflects whether the queue is active.
 *
 * SSR: Safe — initial render returns `[initialState, dispatchAction, false]`.
 * Reactivity: Bridge — state and pending flag are signal-backed slots.
 *
 * Usage: Call `useActionState` at the top level of your component to track the result of an action.
 *
 * @param reducerAction - Function called when the action is triggered. Receives `previousState` and `actionPayload`.
 * @param initialState - Initial value for the state. (Ignored after first dispatch.)
 * @param permalink - Optional unique page URL for progressive enhancement in Server Components.
 * @returns `[state, dispatchAction, isPending]`
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import { useActionState } from "sinwan/react-client";
 *
 * async function submit(prev: { ok: boolean }, fd: FormData) {
 *   await fetch("/api", { method: "POST", body: fd });
 *   return { ok: true };
 * }
 *
 * const Form = () => {
 *   const [state, dispatchAction, pending] = useActionState(submit, { ok: false });
 *   return <form action={dispatchAction as any}>...</form>;
 * };
 * ```
